# üë¶ About Me
- I graduated from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca) with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Honours Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Xujie Si](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xsi). I also worked with [Prof. Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/lab.html), [Prof. Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/) for graduate studies.

- I visited Stanford University on Fall 2019 to pursue advanced studies in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. My last year of university research focused on software engineering applications, statistical learning theory, and the application of ML/DL topics. In addition to this, I am also interested in the application of computer vision to medical imaging, computer graphics for the simulation of natural ecosystems, and computing theory.

- I joined Amazon Web Services as a software engineer after graduation. I worked on daily ops investigation to analyze customer impact and undertake maintenance of affected AWS services. In addition to this, I also worked on existing features addition, local unit testing, integration testing and deployment on CI/CD pipeline.

# üìù Works
## SoftWare Engineering Application
- [Intelligent-Video-Recommendation-System](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Intelligent-Video-Recommendation-System)  


The work is to create a movie recommender system for a movie streaming service with about 1 million customers and 27k movies.

## Machine Learning Topics
- [Application on Case Analysis of Active Learning in Reducing Annotation Cost](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Application-on-Case-Analysis-of-Active-Learning-in-Reducing-Annotation-Cost)  

The work is to analyze the performance of active learning labeling costs reduction using AIFT algorithm in a medical imaging case study.

- [Predicting-climate-change-driven-changes-in-plant-distribution](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Predicting-climate-change-driven-changes-in-plant-distribution)  

The work is to raise a proposal of methodology of using deep learning to predict climate change effects to local ecosystem distribution.

- [Neural-Symbolic-Reasoning-for-Handwritten-Expression-Evaluation](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Neural-Symbolic-Reasoning-for-Handwritten-Expression-Evaluation)  
The work conducted experiments on inverse nerual symbolic logical reasoning for handwritten expressions with DeepProbLog and discovered limitations of gradient semiring in nonelementary arithmetic reasoning.
