Hi, this is Kangrui Ren!

My research interests focus on computer vision and perception, statistical learning theory, Human-Computer/Robotic Interaction.

I graduated from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca) with a bachelor’s degree in Honours Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Xujie Si](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xsi). I also worked with [Prof. Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/lab.html), [Prof. Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), and [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/) for graduate project studies. 

I visited Stanford University as a part-time student in May 2019 and I joined Amazon Web Services as a software engineer intern starting in Feb 2022. 

If you are interested in learning more about me, please see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yj9RRB_Qn2-HFUhxPJOotCS6eTI0KN7D/view?usp=sharing).


# 📝 Works
## Software Engineering Applications
- [Intelligent-Video-Recommendation-System](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Intelligent-Video-Recommendation-System)  
  The work created a movie recommendation system for a movie streaming service with about 1 million customers and 27k movies.
  
- [Online Hotel Booking Database Management System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cPud3bsF08WWvg0gXF1v9bIzB_zDEk_A?usp=sharing)  
  The work created an online hotel booking system as a platform for hotel-to-guest communications, which offers sound and elementary management requirements.
  
- [Distributed Travel Reservation System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11CwL1YIGfixglh8W0nFGtC3q5_1DmH9z?usp=sharing)  
  The work implemented a multi-client, multi-server travel reservation system using Remote Method Invocation and TCP sockets, which provides integrated travel booking services.

## Machine Learning Topics
- [Application on Case Analysis of Active Learning in Reducing Annotation Cost](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z2UEpMi762UmMe-_OXGbVc3r4qeD-2Q-/view?usp=sharing)  
  The work analyzed the performance of active learning labeling costs reduction using AIFT algorithm in a medical imaging case study.

- [Predicting-climate-change-driven-changes-in-plant-distribution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1epxWRMVJHSaiT6j6yeoh8Zhmpd8TRDs2/view?usp=sharing)  
  The work raised a proposal for a methodology of using deep learning to predict climate change effects on local ecosystem distribution.

- [Neural-Symbolic-Reasoning-for-Handwritten-Expression-Evaluation](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Neural-Symbolic-Reasoning-for-Handwritten-Expression-Evaluation)   
  The work conducted experiments on inverse neural symbolic logical reasoning for handwritten expressions with DeepProbLog and discovered limitations of gradient semiring in nonelementary arithmetic reasoning.
  
- [Semi-Static Visual Representation of Quadruped Bionic Robot](https://www.yobotics.cn/)  
  This work aims to take Li-DAR/Infrared based visual multi-modal quadruped bionic robot perception learning and obstacle detection.
  I mainly engaged in system algorithm construction and multi-modal perception analysis.
  
- [Active Coal Mining Robot Perception in Transportation Environment](https://www.yobotics.cn/)  
  This work aims to ensure the reliability of global obstacles detection, severe case evasion, regular memorization during robot transportation.
  I mainly engaged in model improvement in representation learning and prototypical network.
