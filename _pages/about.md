<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am Kangrui Ren, with a primary research focus on computer vision, perception, statistical learning theory, and Human-Computer/Robotic Interaction.

I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Honours Computer Science from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca), where I was advised by [Prof. Xujie Si](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xsi). My academic journey also includes collaborative research with [Prof. Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/lab.html), [Prof. Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), and [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/) for graduate project studies. 

In May 2019, I attended Stanford University as a part-time student, further broadening my academic horizons. Since February 2022, I have been contributing as a software engineer at Amazon Web Services.

Starting Sept 2024, I am set to join [Prof. Gaang Lee](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/gaang)'s laboratory to commence my Master's and Ph.D. studies.

For further details, please refer to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yj9RRB_Qn2-HFUhxPJOotCS6eTI0KN7D/view?usp=sharing).


# üìù Works
## Software Engineering Applications
- [Intelligent-Video-Recommendation-System](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Intelligent-Video-Recommendation-System)  
  The work created a movie recommendation system for a movie streaming service with about 1 million customers and 27k movies.
  
- [Online Hotel Booking Database Management System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cPud3bsF08WWvg0gXF1v9bIzB_zDEk_A?usp=sharing)  
  The work developed an online hotel booking system to facilitate hotel-to-guest communications and meet basic management needs.
  
- [Distributed Travel Reservation System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11CwL1YIGfixglh8W0nFGtC3q5_1DmH9z?usp=sharing)  
  The work confirmed a multi-client, multi-server travel reservation system using RMI and TCP sockets, offering integrated travel booking services.

## Machine Learning Topics
- [Application on Case Analysis of Active Learning in Reducing Annotation Cost](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z2UEpMi762UmMe-_OXGbVc3r4qeD-2Q-/view?usp=sharing)  
  The work analyzed the performance of active learning labeling costs reduction using AIFT algorithm in a medical imaging case study.

- [Predicting-climate-change-driven-changes-in-plant-distribution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1epxWRMVJHSaiT6j6yeoh8Zhmpd8TRDs2/view?usp=sharing)  
  The work raised a proposal for a methodology of using deep learning to predict climate change effects on local ecosystem distribution.

- [Neural-Symbolic-Reasoning-for-Handwritten-Expression-Evaluation](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Neural-Symbolic-Reasoning-for-Handwritten-Expression-Evaluation)   
  The work experimented with inverse neural symbolic logical reasoning for handwritten expressions using DeepProbLog.
  It also identified limitations of the gradient semiring in non-elementary arithmetic reasoning.
  
- [Semi-Static Visual Representation of Quadruped Bionic Robot](https://www.yobotics.cn/)  
  This work aims to take Li-DAR/Infrared based visual multi-modal quadruped bionic robot perception learning and obstacle detection.
  
- [Active Coal Mining Robot Perception in Transportation Environment](https://www.yobotics.cn/)  
  This work aims to ensure the reliability of global obstacles detection, severe case evasion, regular memorization during robot transportation.
