<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I graduated from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca) with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Honours Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Xujie Si](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xsi). I also worked with [Prof. Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/lab.html), [Prof. Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/), [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/) for graduate project studies. I visited Stanford University in Fall 2019 to pursue advanced studies in artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

I joined Amazon Web Services as a software engineer after graduation. I worked on daily ops investigation to analyze customer impact and undertake maintenance of affected AWS services. In addition, I also worked on existing features addition, local unit testing, integration testing, and deployment on CI/CD pipeline.

My Undergraduate research include software engineering applications, the theory of statistical learning, and high-level logical reasoning in DL.
In addition, I'm also interested in computer vision, multimodal machine learning, and theoretical computer science.


# üìù Works
## Software Engineering Applications
- [Intelligent-Video-Recommendation-System](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Intelligent-Video-Recommendation-System)  
  The work (advised by [Prof. Jin Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/lab.html)) created a movie recommender system for a movie streaming service with about 1 million customers and 27k movies.
  
- [Online Hotel Booking Database Management System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cPud3bsF08WWvg0gXF1v9bIzB_zDEk_A?usp=sharing)  
  The work created an online hotel booking system as a platform for hotel-to-guest communications, it offers sound and elementary management requirements.
  
- [Distributed Travel Reservation System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11CwL1YIGfixglh8W0nFGtC3q5_1DmH9z?usp=sharing)  
  The work implemented a multi-client, multi-server travel reservation system using Remote Method Invocation and TCP sockets, which provides integrated travel booking services.

## Machine Learning Topics
- [Application on Case Analysis of Active Learning in Reducing Annotation Cost](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Application-on-Case-Analysis-of-Active-Learning-in-Reducing-Annotation-Cost)  
  The work (advised by [Prof. Prakash Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/)) analyzed the performance of active learning labeling costs reduction using AIFT algorithm in a medical imaging case study.

- [Predicting-climate-change-driven-changes-in-plant-distribution](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Predicting-climate-change-driven-changes-in-plant-distribution)  
  The work (advised by [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/)) raised a proposal of methodology of using deep learning to predict climate change effects on local ecosystem distribution.

- [Neural-Symbolic-Reasoning-for-Handwritten-Expression-Evaluation](https://github.com/KangruiRen0102/Neural-Symbolic-Reasoning-for-Handwritten-Expression-Evaluation)   
  The work (supervised by [Prof. Xujie Si](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xsi)) conducted experiments on inverse neural symbolic logical reasoning for handwritten expressions with DeepProbLog and discovered limitations of gradient semiring in nonelementary arithmetic reasoning.
  
- [Obstacle visual detection and multimodal interaction of quadruped bionic robot](https://www.yobotics.cn/)  
  In this work, the depth information and infrared information are fused, and the adaptive threshold is used to segment the obstacle from the background for accuracy issues.
